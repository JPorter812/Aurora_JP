Approach: 

* Ignore market 3 as you’re not going to make much profit with this market compared to 1 and 2. 
* Model battery as only charging/discharging at maximum rate. 
* Model battery efficiency only by adjusting profit accordingly 
* Only make sales if the battery has the capacity/energy. Allow a given trading strategy to “try” charge/discharge if it wants to. 
* Always choose the market with the lowest price for buy, and highest price for sale. 
* Only optimise for two parameters: buy and sell time during the day. Assume they are fixed for the entire time period. (You could make it a parameterised variable to be more optimal)
* Buy/Sell for two hours until full/empty
* Degradation deemed out of scope - won’t affect the outcome in an interesting way. 
* Convergence doesn't need to be too precise since the landscape is "steppy". So a swarm like algorithm is going to do the best job, and won't 
need many iterations.
